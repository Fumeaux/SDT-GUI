# SDT-GUI
This is my Secondary Design Tool!
You can use it and if you found it helpful at all, I would like for you to tell others about this tool. This helps me to help more people.

The main idea of this tool was to create a more interactive way to design your secondarys. I am aware that JavaTC is currently one of the most used tool out there, but it really isn't that interactive and quite complex for beginners. Those two problems I tried to tackle with this project. So if you have any suggestions on how to make this program more useful you can write an email to fumeaux.tc@gmail.com or visit the post in the highvoltageforum https://highvoltageforum.net/index.php?topic=611.0.
